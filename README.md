# Hello, world! 

My name is **Ahmad Rizky**. You can call me **Rizky**, but my friends call me **Iky**.

I am exposed to Data and Machine Learning field for more than a year and gaining more interest in Data Engineering, Data Pipeline, and Data Infrastructure Management. I am also proficient in programming, especially with Python and SQL. From my current job position, I am developed proficiency on Computer Vision, Image Processing, Data Lake and Warehouse Management, Data Processing, Data Scheduling, and many more.

I am a Bachelor of Science (S.Si.) from IPB University, majoring in Physics. I took Computational Physics of Material as topic for my undergraduate thesis. It can be accessed [here](https://repository.ipb.ac.id/handle/123456789/113548). I've also taken subjects that support my career in IT field as Data Enthusiast as follows:
* Algorithm and Programming. I've learned about Computational Thinking, Building Algorithm, and Practical Python.
* Statistical Method. I've learned about Basic Statistics that important for Data Analysis.
* Computational Physics. I've learned to solve Physics Problem computationally by using approximation.
* Digital Electronics. I've learned about Logical Operators and its implementation on Electrical Circuit.
* Microprocessor and Interface. I've learned about Assembly Language and Arduino Programming to control simple end-to-end electronic system.
* Database. I've learned about Data Relationship and its Structure, PostgreSQL, and made a simple web integrated with Database as final project.
* Control System. I've learned about Working on Linux and made a simple web integrated with Database that scrap data from API simultaneously.

I am a Machine Learning Distinction Graduate from Bangkit 2022 Program, which help me to fulfill my interest in Data and Machine Learning field. From this program, I've learned about:
