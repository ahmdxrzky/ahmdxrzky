# Hello, world! 

My name is **Ahmad Rizky**. You can call me **Rizky**, but many of my friends call me **Iky**.

I am a Physics Undergraduate Student at IPB University. From my major, I've also taken subjects related with IT field:
* Algorithm and Programming. I've learned about Computational Thinking, Building Algorithm, and Practical Python.
* Statistical Method. I've learned about Basic Statistics that important for Data Analysis.
* Computational Physics. I've learned to solve Physics Problem computationally by using approximation.
* Digital Electronics. I've learned about Logical Operators and its implementation on Electrical Circuit.
* Microprocessor and Interface. I've learned about Assembly Language and Arduino Programming to control simple end-to-end electronic system.
* Database. I've learned about Data Relationship and its Structure, PostgreSQL, and made a simple web integrated with Database as final project.
* Control System. I've learned about Working on Linux and made a simple web integrated with Database that generate data from API simultaneously.


I am a Machine Learning Graduate with Distinction from Bangkit 2022 Program, which help me to fulfill my interest in Data and Machine Learning field. From this program, I've taken courses and learn about:

I've achieved a title called [Honorable Mention](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PpgIUSVuKYuFPvse1weFGS1VCi5n8oIo/view?usp=sharing) on Kompetisi Nasional Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam (KNMIPA) Program held by Kemendikbudristekdikti on 2021. I also have joined a certification program for [Microcredential Associate Data Scientist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g1V7wpu8w_YRYIlDTqmNpCZCc7d25Z4w/view?usp=sharing), also held by Kemendikbudristekdikti on 2021. I also have joined a bootcamp for [Beginner Data Scientist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14MRHkb2QgAhvvXKvIoYq6RCnWiC2xA14/view?usp=sharing) held by DQLab.
